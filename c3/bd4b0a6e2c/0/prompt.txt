<bash-input>which ll</bash-input>

<bash-stdout>ll: aliased to ls -lh</bash-stdout><bash-stderr></bash-stderr>

I defined alias ls='ls -aG' in .zshrc, but current zsh shows the different ailas ls. how can I fix this?

---

<bash-input>source ~/.zshrc && which ls</bash-input>

---

<bash-stdout>ls: aliased to ls -aG</bash-stdout><bash-stderr></bash-stderr>

---

---

<bash-input>pwd</bash-input>

---

<bash-stdout>/Users/naokisega/src/github.com/nsega/dotfiles</bash-stdout><bash-stderr></bash-stderr>

<bash-input>alias ll</bash-input>

---

<bash-stdout>ll='ls -lh'</bash-stdout><bash-stderr></bash-stderr>

---

the alias ll defied at ~/.zshrc is different from the current terminal's alias. how can I address that?

---

no, i want to show colornized list via ll alias.

---

colorized(-G) didn't work in ghossty. how can I fix that?

---

no, still didn't colorize the result of ls and ll both.

---

it works. Still, do we need to set  export CLICOLOR=1 ?
